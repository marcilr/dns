  The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and
  decentralized naming system for computers, services,
  or other resources connected to the Internet or a
  private network.  It associates various information
  with domain names assigned to each of the participating
  entities.  Most prominently, it translates more readily
  memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses
  needed for locating and identifying computer services
  and devices with the underlying network protocols.  By
  providing a worldwide, distributed directory service,
  the Domain Name System has been an essential component
  of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.
