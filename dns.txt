Domain Name System (DNS)


The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and
decentralized naming system for computers, services,
or other resources connected to the Internet or a
private network.  It associates various information
with domain names assigned to each of the participating
entities.  Most prominently, it translates more readily
memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses
needed for locating and identifying computer services
and devices with the underlying network protocols.  By
providing a worldwide, distributed directory service,
the Domain Name System has been an essential component
of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.
